### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### :herb: My name is Andrew Samylkin :raising_hand_man: :herb:

When I was studying at the university, I took an interest in statistics and data analysis. After graduating from university, I started my career working for an oil refinery plant as an engineer who was in charge of automatization of various refining and petrochemical processes. Iâ€™ve applied my knowledge of statistics and algorithms. I have recently interesting in data analysis and machine learning and I was qualified as Data Analyst. I am fan of working with data and applying my knowledge to solve various cases and get some insights. I enjoy learning something new every time and working with it in reality.
